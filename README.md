# Whitelister

I made this my special request from a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/gpvruh/free_plugin_creation/frp1hwp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). 

## What it does

When a player joins the whitelist is checked to see if they are on it, and added if they are not.
*Why would you do that?* one might ask. 
As it was explained to me, the white list is to enforce no **new** players joins for purposes of testing or during special events, but when we do not want players to be kicked when it is enabled.

## Installing

Just put the jar from [releases](https://github.com/Magnum97/Whitelister/releases) into your `server/plugins/` folder and (re)start the server. 

## Commands

Currently there are no commands but if requested I may add one to enable/disable the auto-add functionality without having to stop the server.

## Permissions

There are no permissions.
